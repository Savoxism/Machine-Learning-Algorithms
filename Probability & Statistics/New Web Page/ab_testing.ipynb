    "Hello everyone, in this small project we are going to look at some practical use of A/B Testing. Recently, a company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who \"convert,\" meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Our goal is to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this task, we will define functions that estimate the relevant information out of the samples, compute the relevant statistic given each case and make a decision on whether to (or not) reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT!! The actual metric being tested is \"converted\" (whether a user made a purchase), which is a binary outcome (0 or 1). The code treats this as if it were a continuous variable. For binary outcomes, it's more common to use a chi-square test or logistic regression rather than a t-test. That said, with large sample sizes (which you have here), the t-test can still provide valid results due to the Central Limit Theorem. The means calculated here represent the proportion of conversions in each group.\n",
