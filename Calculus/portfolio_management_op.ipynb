        "Your Company is aiming to minimize production costs of some goods. During the production process, an essential product P is used, which can be supplied from one of two partners - supplier A and supplier B. Your consultants requested the historical prices of product P from both suppliers A and B, which were provided as monthly averages for the period from February 2018 to March 2020.\n",
        "\n",
        "Preparing Company Budget for the coming twelve months period, your plan is to purchase the same amount of product P monthly. Choosing the supplier, you noticed, that there were some periods in the past, when it would be more profitable to use supplier A (the prices of product P were lower), and other periods to work with supplier B. For the Budget model you can set some percentage of the goods to be purchased from supplier A (e.g. 60%) and the remaining part from supplier B (e.g. 40%), but this split should be kept consistent for the whole of the twelve months period. The Budget will be used in preparation for the contract negotiations with both suppliers.\n",
        "\n",

And historically there were various periods of time when it was better to take $\\omega = 1$ ($p_A^i < p_B^i$) or $\\omega = 0$ ($p_A^i >p_B^i$). Is it possible now to choose some $\\omega$ value that would provide some evidence of minimum costs in the future?"

        "This is a standard **portfolio management** (investment) problem well known in statistics, where based on the historical prices you need to make investment decision to maximize profit (minimize costs). Since statistics has not been covered in this Course, you do not need to understand the details about the function $\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\omega\\right)$ (called **loss function**) to minimize, explained in the next paragraph.\n",

Then take an average of those values, $\\overline{f\\left (\\omega\\right)}=\\text{mean}\\left(f^i\\left(\\omega\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{i=1}^{k}f^i\\left(\\omega\\right)$ and look for such value of $\\omega$ which makes $f^i\\left(\\omega\\right)$ as \"stable\" as possible - varying as little as possible from the average $\\overline{f\\left (\\omega\\right)}$. This means that you would want to minimize the sum of the differences $\\left(f^i \\left(\\omega\\right) -  \\overline{f\\left (\\omega\\right)}\\right)$. As the differences can be negative or positive, a common approach is to take the squares of those and take an average of the squares:\n",

Again, do not worry if you do not understand deeply why particularly this function $\\mathcal{L}\\left(\\omega\\right)$ was chosen.
